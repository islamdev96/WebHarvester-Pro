# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a web scraping system to extract all exporter data from the Egyptian Ministry of Trade and Industry's exporters directory (http://www.expoegypt.gov.eg/exporters) and convert it into structured JSON format. The system will systematically collect company information, contact details, and business data from the website.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to extract all exporter company data from the Egyptian exporters website, so that I can analyze Egyptian export businesses in a structured format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scraper is executed THEN the system SHALL access the Egyptian exporters website at http://www.expoegypt.gov.eg/exporters
2. WHEN the website is accessed THEN the system SHALL navigate through all available pages and sections
3. WHEN company data is found THEN the system SHALL extract company names, contact information, business categories, and any other available details
4. WHEN data extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL convert all extracted data into valid JSON format
5. WHEN JSON conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL save the data to a structured file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the scraper to handle website navigation and pagination automatically, so that all available data is collected without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scraper encounters pagination THEN the system SHALL automatically navigate to all pages
2. WHEN the scraper encounters different sections or categories THEN the system SHALL explore all available sections
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with appropriate delays
4. WHEN rate limiting is detected THEN the system SHALL respect the website's rate limits and implement appropriate delays
5. IF the website structure changes THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what failed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want the extracted data to be properly structured and validated, so that I can reliably use the JSON output for further processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is extracted THEN the system SHALL validate that all required fields are present
2. WHEN creating JSON output THEN the system SHALL ensure proper JSON formatting and encoding (UTF-8 for Arabic text)
3. WHEN duplicate entries are found THEN the system SHALL remove or flag duplicate records
4. WHEN the extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of extracted records
5. WHEN errors occur during extraction THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the scraper to be configurable and maintainable, so that it can be easily updated if the website structure changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scraper is configured THEN the system SHALL allow customization of request delays and retry attempts
2. WHEN the scraper runs THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and logging
3. WHEN the website structure changes THEN the system SHALL use configurable selectors that can be easily updated
4. WHEN the scraper completes THEN the system SHALL generate logs showing what was extracted and any issues encountered
5. IF the scraper needs to be stopped THEN the system SHALL allow graceful interruption and resume capability
